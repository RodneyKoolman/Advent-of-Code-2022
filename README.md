# Advent of Code 2022

I'm doing the Advent of Code 2022 in Python. I'm using this repository to keep track of my progress.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Do Advent of Code yourself

1. Go to adventofcode.com, start with day 1
2. Use your favorite programming language to solve the puzzles
